In this version, the change is that when searching using the mfr_number or model name as the search term, after retrieving the results, we apply the following logic: If there is only one product, we keep it. If multiple products are found, we compare each productâ€™s mfr_number with the search term. If we find an exact match, we keep that product and extract the required data; otherwise, we skip it.
